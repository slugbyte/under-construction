# plain html (ish)

This `Under Construction` page is a single html file with a little styling.
Most of the styling is achieved using [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)
a functional CSS library. Tachyons all allows you to style a page by adding
class names to the tags in your html. Tachyons and other functional css tools
are great for rapid prototyping layouts that need to be responsive. Recently
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) has brought a lot of attention to this type of styling. If you
haven't tried functional css before I highly recommend giving it a try.

Recently I wanted to better understand how to make a functional css library, and
made my own: [nudge.css](https://github.com/slugbyte/nudge.css). I don't recommend
using it in your projects, but the sass in it simple to read (i hope) and might help you understand
better how functional css librarys work :)
